[Verse]
In a world of waste and clutter, we need a change
A platform that's open-source, where we can rearrange
ReCycler's here to save the day, with a modern twist
It's time to recycle, and let your love persist
[Verse 2]
With ReCycler, it's easier than you think
Sorting trash and compost, it's all in sync
Reduce, reuse, recycle, that's our creed
Come join the movement, it's the planet's need
[Chorus]
ReCycle, ReCycle, open your heart
ReCycle, ReCycle, let's all do our part
Together we can make a difference, it's true
ReCycle, ReCycle, for a better world, we choose
