## Overview

_With ReCycler, it’s easier than you think!_

ReCycler is an open-source platform aimed at creating a more modern and user-centric recycling service, building upon the data foundation of the existing kierrätys.info. ReCycler platform leverages the kierrätys.info API (https://api.kierratys.info/) to obtain basic information about recycling collection spots. Additionally, the service utilizes Mapbox's mapping and location-based services. The idea of the platform is to provide solutions to various use cases efficiently and seamlessly.

## Demo
You can test the development version of ReCycler at: http://www.recyclerapp.fi. Please note that the development version may not be the same as the version published on GitHub.

## Features
### User-friendly interface for smart recycling guidance
ReCycler provides an intuitive interface featuring a map view that visualizes the locations of recommended recycling collection spots along with detailed information about each site. ReCycler can dynamically display the user’s current location on the map, so the user does not need to manually adjust the map while moving.
