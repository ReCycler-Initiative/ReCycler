Organization Registration and User Management

1. Service Entry Point
- The service includes a public landing page with “Sign in” and “Register organization” options.
- A registration wizard guides new organizations through setup, creating the initial Super Admin user — the owner of the entire service instance.

2. Organizational Structure
- Every user belongs to at least one organization.
- Each organization must have at least one Org Admin responsible for managing users and settings.
- The same user can act as an Org Admin in multiple organizations.

3. Organization Setup Process
- After registration, the Org Admin is prompted (via wizard) to:
  - Complete the organization’s profile and contact details.
  - Invite or add users to the organization.
- Organizations may have user limits (e.g., up to 10 users) depending on the subscription plan.
- Alternatively, domain-based access can be enabled — for example, users with an email address under @example-firm-ltd.com can automatically join the organization without manual approval.

4. Roles and Permissions
Each organization has a role-based access model with the following roles:

- Org Admin: Manages the entire organization, including all associated services and users.
- Owner: Manages a specific service or use case within the organization. The same user may be an Owner for multiple services across organizations.
- Editor: Can edit a single service’s content, configurations, or data.
- Viewer: Has read-only access to view information related to a service.

5. Authentication and Identity
- User identities are managed via Auth0, using user_id (Auth0 sub claim) and email as the key identifiers.
- Each user is linked to one or more organizations within the service database, while Auth0 handles all identity, login, and authentication flows.
- All users must authenticate using an Auth0-supported method (e.g., social login, enterprise SSO, or passwordless login).

6. Data Protection and Compliance
- The service itself stores no personal data beyond what is required for authentication and role assignment.
- All personal information (e.g., email, name) is managed by Auth0.
- As a result, the service does not create additional GDPR-related obligations beyond those covered by Auth0’s compliance framework.
